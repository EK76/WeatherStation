Kenne's Weather Station.

I started this Visual Studio C# project in spring 2024.
Purpose for this project is to measure, temperature, humidity and pressure
with help of two sensors (DHT11 and BMP180) and Raspberry PI 5.

The sensors values are stored to MySQL database from which the Kenne's Weather Station
application reads the values and show results on a computer screen as for example diagram.
